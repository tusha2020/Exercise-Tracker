## Exercise Tracker

*Exercise tracker* is a program which provides users with a space to organize 
their specialized exercise routines and keep track of their progress. This program will 
provide service  to users such as scheduling exercise times, creating exercise routines, and keeping track of time. 
This program is designed to support all who wish to enhance their exercise journey and lead a healthy lifestyle. 
I am interested in pursuing a healthy lifestyle, but it is hard to stay motivated and organized which 
is why I think this program is useful. 



###User Stories:

###Phase 4: task 3
- The scheduleFrame class would be more cohesive if it was associated to a combination box class, which would
  be responsible for adding the panel with combination boxes and handling its events. 
- I would make The ExerciseTrackerGui class be associated with more than 2 routines.
- I believe the Gui class does not require to be associated with the exercise class, if I had time I would
    work on removing that association.
